# Analyzing the Great Wildebeest Migration in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem: Patterns, Environmental Influences, and Conservation Implications
Description:
This study investigates the dynamics of the Great Wildebeest Migration in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, a globally significant biodiversity hotspot spanning northern Tanzania and southwestern Kenya. It examines how environmental factors such as biomass distribution, geographical features, and human activity impact migration patterns. Using GIS data, GPS tracking, aerial surveys, and remote sensing, the research visualizes migration routes from 2012 to 2018, revealing gradual shifts in movement and herd sizes over time.

The paper highlights the role of satellite imagery and spatial analysis tools, including ArcGIS Online and World Imagery datasets, to map migration paths and correlate them with biomass and livestock distribution. Observations suggest that while migration routes remain relatively consistent, herd sizes have increased, potentially influenced by changing environmental conditions and resource availability.

The study emphasizes the ecological importance of the Great Migration, its contribution to nutrient cycling, and its influence on the Serengeti-Mara’s ecosystem structure. It also underscores the need for long-term conservation strategies to address habitat fragmentation and human-wildlife conflicts that threaten this natural phenomenon.

Future research aims to quantify the relationship between biomass, vegetation patterns, and migration routes using statistical analysis and mathematical modeling to draw more specific conclusions.

This research builds upon previous studies, including Musiega and Kazadi’s work on migration patterns using GIS and remote sensing, contributing to the broader understanding of wildlife movements and ecological sustainability.
